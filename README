CLAS12 FCAL README

--------------------------------------------------

Before running the simulation, one must install GEMC, following Maurizio's instructions on http://gemc.jlab.org


Set the environmental variable $GEMC to point to the location where the GEMC resources are located.

If you're on MacOS, add the following lines to your ~/.bash_profile (replacing 2.6 with whatever version you have)

export GEMC=/Applications/gemc-2.6.app/gemc.app/Contents/Resources/
export GEMC_DATA_DIR=$GEMC
alias gemc='$GEMC/../MacOS/gemc.command' #MacOS only

Similarly, on Linux, add the first two of the lines above ~/.bashrc file, with $GEMC pointing to the installation directory.  You will then need to put the directory containing the gemc executable in the $PATH.  


You'll need the magnetic fields in order to run the simulations
wget http://clasweb.jlab.org/12gev/field_maps/clas12SolenoidFieldMap.dat $GEMC_DATA_DIR
wget http://clasweb.jlab.org/12gev/field_maps/clas12TorusOriginalMap.dat $GEMC_DATA_DIR

You will also need to soft-link the "experiments" directory to the one in the GEMC installation in order to get the rest of clas12 into the simulation.  Run this in the same directory where the fcal.gcard is located:

ln -s $GEMC_DATA_DIR/experiments experiments

To build the geometry, banks, hit defs and materials for the fcal, run the following command

perl ./fcal.pl config.dat

To run the simulation with the fcal + the rest of the CLAS12:

gemc fcal.gcard

To run the simulation with only the fcal:
gemc fcal_only.gcard

You can override the settings of a gcard by adding additional arguments, for instance, "gemc fcal_only.gcard -USE_GUI=0" will disable the graphical user interface.  You can learn more about GEMC settings by doing

gemc -help
