CLAS12 FCAL README

--------------------------------------------------

Before running the simulation, one must install GEMC, following Maurizio's instructions on http://gemc.jlab.org

On MacOs, he's provided a DMG for the 


set the environmental variable $GEMC to point to the correct location.
(note: this line can be added to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile or equivalent):

export GEMC=/Applications/gemc-2.6.app/gemc.app/Contents/Resources/

The command to build the geometry, banks, hit defs and materials is:
perl ./fcal.pl config.dat

Then, to run the simulation
/Applications/gemc-2.6.app/gemc.app/Contents/MacOs/gemc.command fcal.gcard

Play around with settings in the GUI.
